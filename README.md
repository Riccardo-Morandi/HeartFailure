# HeartFailure
 Monitoring drugs-based therapeutic paths in heart failure patients

 This repo contains the code related to the project for the Applied Statistics course taught by Prof. Secchi at Politecnoco di Milano

## Abstract: 

Heart failure is a pathophysiological state in which the heart fails to supply the required amount of blood
and oxygen to the body. In Europe, HF is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospitalization
among adults and affects 1-2% of the population. Proper treatment may improve the symptoms of heart
failure and may help some people live longer but 1 out of 2 patients with chronic diagnosis is non-
adherent to drugs.
The focus of the study is on the adherence during the first year of observation which measures
the obedience of the patient to the medical therapy.
The main objective is the development of an innovative method for profiling patients based on
different drug-utilization behaviors focusing on the analysis of polytherapy and investigating the impact
of such profiles on patientsâ€™ overall survival and rehospitalization. The interest is also on the impact of
adherence on time-to-event outcomes such as date of death and date of next hospitalization for the
subjects.
